# 🧪 QDensity Tools (QDT): A WFX/CUBE Density Analysis Toolkit

QDensity Tools (QDT) is a Python-based toolkit for analyzing and visualizing electron density-related properties from quantum chemistry wavefunction data in `.wfx` or `.cube` file formats.

It enables the computation and visualization of the following properties:

- **Electron Density** (`ρ`)
- **Electron Density Gradient Magnitude** (`|∇ρ|`)
- **Laplacian of Electron Density** (`∇²ρ`)
- **Reduced Density Gradient** (`s`)
- **NCI Indicator** (`log10[s \* ρ] \* sign(λ₂)`)
- **NCI Scatter Plot** (`s` vs `sign(λ₂)ρ`) #in development
- **Bond Critical Points (BCPs)**

## ▶️ How to Use

### 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy numba joblib tqdm
```

### 2. Add Your `.wfx` or `.cube` File

Place your `.wfx` file inside the `data/` folder. Example:

```
data/molecule.wfx
```

### 3. Run the Project

Adjust parameters in `main.py` (paths, atoms for paths, grid size, etc.) and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This can:

* Parse the `.wfx` or `.cube` file
* Calculate and save 3D electron density as `density.cube`
* Generate and save plots for density, gradient magnitude, and Laplacian slices
* Plot density-related properties along a chosen interatomic path
* Detect and save Bond Critical Points (BCPs) coordinates
* Save all outputs in the `data/` folder


### 4. Additional Modules

#### `rdg_calc.py`

Calculates and plots the **reduced density gradient** (`s`), with logarithmic scaling (`log10(s)`) to enhance visibility across large dynamic ranges.

#### `s_sign_lambda2_rho_p.py`

Computes and plots the field `log10[s * ρ] * sign(λ2)`, commonly used in Non-Covalent Interaction (NCI) analysis to highlight weak interaction regions. The logarithmic term facilitates clearer graphical interpretation.

## 📊 Example Output

* Example calculation and results for a water molecule are in `/data`, including:

  * `data/density_gradient_laplacian_path_O_H.png`: log-scaled density, gradient, and Laplacian between O and H atoms
  * `data/reduced_gradient_slice_custom_plane_0_1_2.png`: Reduced density gradient slice in a selected molecular plane
  * `data/s_sign_lambda2_rho_slice_custom_plane_0_1_2.png`: Slice of `log10[s * ρ] * sign(λ2)` field
  * `data/h2o.cube`: Cube file representing 3D electron density
  * `data/BCPs.xyz`: Coordinates of detected bond critical points
 * Some other results and .wfx files for test

## 📚 Documentation

Each module contains internal docstrings for all public functions. Use:

```bash
pydoc parser
```

Or explore via an IDE like VSCode or PyCharm.

## 📌 Notes

* Paths between atoms are selected via atom indices in `main.py`
* Coordinates and grids are internally handled in atomic units (Bohr); outputs are converted to Angstroms
* Density-related quantities are **log10-scaled and sometimes normalized** for visual comparison
* BCP search is parallelized and computationally efficient
* Future modules (e.g., `analysis.py`, `geometry.py`) extend functionality for custom analyses

## 👨‍🔬 Applications

QDT has been tested for:

- Bonding analysis in transition-metal and lanthanide complexes
- Non-covalent interaction studies (hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding)
- Charge density visualization of reactive intermediates
